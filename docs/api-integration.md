# Dashboard API integration reference

This document catalogues every backend endpoint the AgentPay dashboard calls, with
the exact request body and the response shape the UI expects. Shapes are derived
from `src/lib/apiClient.ts` and the inline TypeScript declarations in each page —
**every shape below matches the code at the cited source.**

All requests go through the lightweight `fetch` wrapper in
[`src/lib/apiClient.ts`](../src/lib/apiClient.ts) (reads are usually issued via the
[`useApi`](../src/lib/useApi.ts) hook). Two call sites — the usage **Record** and
**Query** forms in [`src/app/usage/page.tsx`](../src/app/usage/page.tsx) — use raw
`fetch` directly but follow the same JSON conventions.

## Transport conventions

| Concern | Behaviour | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base URL | `API_BASE` resolved once at module load via `resolveApiBase()`; every path is `${API_BASE}${path}` | `apiClient.ts`, `resolveApiBase.ts` |
| Request headers | `Content-Type: application/json` is sent by default (callers may override) | `apiClient.ts` |
| Request body | `apiPost`/`apiPatch` `JSON.stringify` the supplied object | `apiClient.ts` |
| Empty response | HTTP **204** resolves to `undefined` (no body parsed) | `apiClient.ts` |
| Timeout | Default **10 000 ms**; on expiry the call rejects with `ApiTimeoutError` | `apiClient.ts` |
| Success | 2xx JSON body is returned as the generic `T` | `apiClient.ts` |

### Error envelope (`ApiError`)

Non-2xx responses are expected to carry this JSON envelope; the wrapper throws an
`Error` whose `message` (and `error`/`requestId`) come from it:

```ts
type ApiError = {
  error: string;       // machine-readable code, e.g. "validation_error"
  message: string;     // human-readable; surfaced in the UI
  requestId?: string;  // optional correlation id
};
```

If the body is missing/!ok, the wrapper falls back to `error: "http_error"` and a
`Request failed with status <code>` message.

### Pause flag

A global pause flag is exposed by `GET /api/v1/admin/status` (`{ paused }`) and
`GET /api/v1/stats` (`paused`), and toggled from the Admin page via
`POST /api/v1/admin/pause` / `POST /api/v1/admin/unpause`. **While paused the
backend refuses writes** (the Stats page surfaces "writes are refused"). In the
tables below, **Write** rows are the mutating calls subject to this flag; **Read**
rows are always available.

## Services

| Method & path | Type | Request body | Response shape | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/services?page={page}&limit={limit}` | Read | — | `{ services?: Service[]; items?: Service[]; page?: number; pageCount?: number }` (UI reads `services ?? items`) | `services/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services?q={query}&limit={limit}` | Read | — | `{ services: Service[] }` | `search/page.tsx` |
| `POST /api/v1/services` | Write | `{ serviceId: string; priceStroops: number }` | response ignored by UI | `services/new/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services/{serviceId}` | Read | — | `Service` | `services/[serviceId]/page.tsx`, `.../edit/page.tsx` |
| `PATCH /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/price` | Write | `{ priceStroops: number }` | response ignored by UI | `services/[serviceId]/edit/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/usage` | Read | — | `Rollup` | `services/[serviceId]/page.tsx` |
| `GET /api/v1/services/{serviceId}/agents/top?limit={limit}` | Read | — | `TopAgents` | `services/[serviceId]/agents/page.tsx` |

```ts
type Service   = { serviceId: string; priceStroops: number };
type Rollup    = { serviceId: string; total: number; agents: number };
type TopAgents = { serviceId: string; items: { agent: string; total: number }[] };
```

_Accuracy note: every request/response shape above was transcribed from the
TypeScript type passed to `apiGet`/`apiPost`/`apiPatch`/`useApi` (or the raw
`fetch` body) at the cited source file. If a page's inline type changes, update the
corresponding row here._
